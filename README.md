# Chess

This was a project I did for an Honors Contract in CSE 110.

I plan to continue to update it and incorporate more technical rules, and eventually add my own engine!
The goal is to create a chess engine that can beat me.

## Features to Add

* Game clock
* 3 fold repitition
* 50 move rule
* Draw by agreement
* Draw by insufficient material
* Move history/transcript
* Undo move

## Features to Add (Distant Future)

* User interface
* Chess engine
* Save/load games?
* LAN play?
